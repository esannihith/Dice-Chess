## API Endpoints (The Backend) ‚ôüÔ∏è
These endpoints will form the RESTful API for your Flask backend, managing the game's state and logic.

1. Create a New Game
Endpoint: POST /api/game/new

Purpose: Initializes a new game board on the server.

Request Body: None.

Response Body:

JSON

{
  "gameId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
}
2. Make a Move
Endpoint: POST /api/game/<game_id>/move

Purpose: Allows a player to submit a move. The server validates it, updates the state, and then broadcasts the change via Sockets.

Request Body:

JSON

{
  "move": "e2e4"
}
Response Body (Success):

JSON

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Move accepted and broadcasted."
}
Response Body (Error):

JSON

{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Illegal move."
}
3. Get Game State
Endpoint: GET /api/game/<game_id>

Purpose: Allows a player joining or reconnecting to get the latest state of the game.

Request Body: None.

Response Body:

JSON

{
  "gameId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1",
  "isCheck": false,
  "isGameOver": false
}
## Key Tips for Implementation üí°
1. Use FEN for State Management
Rely on the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string provided by the python-chess library as your single source of truth for the board state. It's a compact string that represents everything: piece positions, whose turn it is, castling rights, and more. Pass this FEN string between your frontend and backend.

2. Separate API Calls and Socket Broadcasts
Use a clean and robust pattern for communication:

A player's move is always sent to the server as a POST request to your /move endpoint. This is an action.

The server validates the move. If it's legal, the server then broadcasts the new FEN string to both players in the game room using Socket.IO. This is an update.
This separates direct actions from state updates, which is a great architectural pattern.

3. Plan Your Socket.IO Events
Don't handle game logic over Sockets; use them only for real-time updates. You'll primarily need three events:

client.emit('join_game', { gameId: '...' }): A player sends this when they load a game, telling the server to add them to a specific "room."

server.emit('update_board', { fen: '...' }, room=gameId): The server sends this to all players in a room after a valid move is made.

server.emit('game_over', { winner: 'white', reason: 'checkmate' }, room=gameId): The server sends this when a game-ending condition is met.

4. Leverage python-chess Fully
Don't write validation logic yourself. Before making a move, use the library's built-in functions:

board.is_legal(move): To check if a move is valid.

board.is_checkmate(): To detect a win.

board.is_stalemate(): To detect a draw.

board.push(move): To update the board object.
